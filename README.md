Words
=====

Generate amusing sentences (sometimes called 'madlibs') by
selecting random words from lists for each part of speech.
Also generates silly names from a list of sounds.

Designed for teaching young children about programming.

# Getting Started

    % python words.py
    Biggles listened to the exploding red marmalade
    % python name.py
    gongoogipquazip

On OSX with FIGlet installed, try runing `words.sh` to display
the sentences as a story, and speak them with the speech synthesiser
at the same time, forever, or until you get bored. The `story.*.log`
file that is printed when the script exits contains all the generated
sentences and speakers.

Similarly, `name.sh` provides a _Flash Card_ experience to show
what learning a language feels like to most people.

Teach yourself gibberish! Read incomprehensible stories! Have fun!
