Generate amusing sentences (sometimes called 'madlibs') by
selecting random words from lists for each part of speech.
Also generates silly names from a list of sounds.

On OSX with FIGlet installed, try runing `words.sh` to display
the sentences and speak them with the speech syntesiser at the
same time, forever, or until you get bored...
